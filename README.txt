Run the game using the "wargame()" function in your terminal

KNOWN BUGS:
 
autoplay does not work properly yet due to issues with my recursive call of round()

whenever the same cards appear TWICE in a row, the game will enter a loop which will cause the program to crash due to recursion being used too many times
